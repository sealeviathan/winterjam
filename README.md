# winterjam
The git project for a small Unity Winter Game Jam!

Not much happening yet, still need to wait for school to get over so we can all focus on this a little bit more.

Make branches to test out the features you're working on without affecting the project as a whole!

Make requests to pull from active branches to add features or fix issues!

Work together to merge working branches to main once milestones are reached!

TODO: Add milestones!
