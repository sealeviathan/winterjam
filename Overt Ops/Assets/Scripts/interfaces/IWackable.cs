public interface IWackable
{
    //This is an interface that the weapon class uses to interact with the environment.
    //The most fun one. Allows a weapon (generally a melee attack main weapon, but I'm no creative hater)
    //To 'wack' back an object. I.E; and most commonly, hitting an airbourne grenade back to sender.
